    Condition 1
        Describe:
            again increased in shading intensity with length, same color
        Explain:
            again I went with a color inbetween the others and varied the length and intensity according to the original pattern
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            the longer the crystal, the lighter the shade
        Explain:
            I tried for a color btween the two other sample groups and followed the established pattern of the level of intensity and length
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            same color family, different shades, different lengths
        Explain:
            chose a color between the first and second, varied the length and shading

=== Subject 18 ===
Phase 1
    Condition 1
        Describe:
            The crystals are the same colors with different shades and different sizes.
        Explain:
            I picked a different color with different shades and sizes.
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            Each group of crystals were categorized by color despite the different sizes of them.
        Explain:
            There has not been a type of crystal that was orange yet on the spectrum of colors.
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            They are categorized by color and their various shades.
        Explain:
            I picked a different color and made them different lengths and chose different shades for them with none of them being the same.

=== Subject 24 ===
Phase 1
    Condition 1
        Describe:
            longest to shortest = brightest to dullest
        Explain:
            using the same pattern
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            deepest shade = smallest crystal
            gradient progression by size    
        Explain:
            using  pattern i saw in the first two crystals
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            all in similar color scheme and different lenghts
        Explain:
            based on the two crystals around the original side

=== Subject 30 ===
Phase 1
    Condition 1
        Describe:
            The crystals within a set had the same color and the same shape and had varying sizes. The yellow set had a smaller smallest crystal this time. 
        Explain:
            I didn't know what color to make the third crystal this time, but I maintained a color throughout the 6 crystals, varying their sizes and shades. 
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            The crystals within a set were of varying sizes and shades of a color. 
        Explain:
            I figured that the third type of crystal would also be of varying shade and size, but continue to maintain a constant color and shape. 
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            The crystals are of varying sizes and shades of a color. Within each set of crystals, no two pieces are the same size of shade. 
        Explain:
            The jump in color from the first type of crystal went from blue to green, so it was logical that the next one would be yellow (backwards rainbow scheme). I also varied my shade and color when coming up with the third type of crystal, but kept th color constant. 

=== Subject 13 ===
Phase 1
    Condition 1
        Describe:
            type 1 has all teal crystals. it appears that shade darkens with longer crystals          
                                                                                                      
            type 2 has all purple crystals. it appears that shade darkens with longer crystals as well
        Explain:
            each type has the same color, so the third type must have a consistent color as well. 
                                                                                                  
            in addition the trend is that shade darkens with longer length crystals               
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            type 1 is always yellow, type 2 is always blue.     
                                                                
            for both types shade is lighter with longer crystals
        Explain:
            following the observations, lighter crystals with longer lengths, and all the same color.
                                                                                                     
            it also seem that each sample had a varying range of lengths and shades                  
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            each type of crystal have a variety of shade and lengths. however, each crystal has the same color within the same type. there appears to be no relation between the length and shade of the crystal
        Explain:
            whoops, see last response for more information.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
            in addition, it seemed like each sample had a wide range of lengths and shades, so it made sense to have both in the set i created, also each set had the same color, so i kept the color consistent.

            Orange is mixture of yellow and red.  Lighter shades are less in length.
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            Turquoise and bright green.  As shade gets darker, length of crystal gets shorter.
        Explain:
            Turquoise/green color to mix between the two, and as gets shorter, gets more saturated in color like the crystals shown before.

    Condition 1
        Describe:
            same color with varying lengths and shades
        Explain:
            I applied the characteristics of the other samples, same color, with varying lengths and shades
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            same color, varying lengths and shades
        Explain:
            the new cyrstals might be roughly the same size , this is why the were catagorized differently
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            each catagory is separted by color. but within each catagory there are varying lengths and shades of that color
        Explain:

=== Subject 14 ===
Phase 1
    Condition 1
        Describe:
            once again, every other crystal goes down in saturation and length, while ther others go up in saturation and length.               
                                                                                                                                                
            Now that I look at these I noticed I made a mistake in the terquoise crystal pattern, it should have been shorter and less saturated
        Explain:
            I followed the same consistent crystal pattern
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            Every other crystal goes either up or down in length as well as in color saturation. there seems to be a pattern in not every consecutive crystal but every other one.
        Explain:
            I assumed that every other crystal would get smaller, and that one pattern gets less and less saturated while the other inner crystals get more saturated
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            once again the every other crystal is in a pattern of either going up or down in saturation
        Explain:
            I followed a similar pattern to the first samples of crystals which is that every other crystal goes down in length and saturation and ther other pattern in there goes up in length and saturation

=== Subject 20 ===
Phase 1
    Condition 1
        Describe:
            As the length of the probe became longer, the probe became more saturated in color.
        Explain:
            I picked a random color, green.  Then I started out with the shortest and most pale crystal.  As I increased the size, I made the crystals more saturated in color.
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            The shorter the crystals were, the brighter color of the crystal was.
        Explain:
            I tried to make the shorter crystals brighter and the longer crystals more pale.
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            As the length of the purple crystals increased, the color became darker and then ligher.
                                                                                                    
            As the length of the blue crystals increased, the color became lighter and then darker. 
        Explain:
            I picked the color pink and since it matches with purple, I used the same trend to determine the relationship between length of crystal and the saturation of color.  As a result, the crystals started short and light.  As the crystals grew in length, they became darker and then lighter.

            order of length.                                                        
        Explain:
            Bottom one has the highest shade,      
            so it feels like it is the heaviest and
            longest part of them.                  
            they are lined in the order of

        Explain:
            colors are quite bright, and it looks like it's 
            kind of on the similar line, even though,       
            not in the exact order of color, length, or

            pretty chaotic there.  
            Color looks pretty cold
            cuz of those blue ones.

=== Subject 21 ===
Phase 1
    Condition 1
        Describe:
            same type of crystals have the same hue.         
            the larger the crystals get, the darker they get.
        Explain:
            i picked a color the same interval from purple that purple was from red (the red on the right). then i followed the same larger = darker rule that the other crystals followed
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            each type of crystal was one particular hue. the hue got lighter as the crystal got longer.
            the ammount each crystal got longer or lighter was pretty much consistent.                 
        Explain:
            since it was a third type of crystal i knew it would be a differnet color. the first crystal was green and the second yellow (moving one color over to the left on the color scale). so i chose just to move one  color over to the left from yellow. also using red made it easier to match all the colors of the crystal family.
            as far as the individual crystals are concerned i followed te same longer crystal, lighter shade pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            the middle one was either the darkest or the lightest and the shade of the other crystals got either darker or lighter as they got longer and shorter than the middle crystal
        Explain:
            i picked a color the same distance away that the other two were.                                                                                                                                                     
            chose to make the middleish crystal in length the darkest and the rest lighter as they got longer and shorter than this crystal.                                                                                     
            i chose to make the middle one darkest instead of lightest (it could have really been either in my mind) simply because the first middle crystal was dark and the second was light and i figured i'd create a pattern

Phase 1
    Condition 1
        Describe:
            The first group of crystals is consistent with color (just varies with shade). The second is contrasted with the lime green crystal. They all vary in length. The orientation remains the same.
        Explain:
            They all vary in length, and the colors are harmonious. 
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            The crystals are geometric. They are pointy at one end, and flat on the other. They vary in length and color. There is a black outline on every crystal.
        Explain:
            I varied the lengths of these crystals such as it was varied with the others. Each group of crystals had a color scheme. I decided to go with pink and make them different shades so they were easier to recognize as a family.
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            The crystals are matched with a single crystal that is a complimentary color (green to pink, blue to orange).

            the crystals were gs80,GS89 snd all are of different sizes
        Explain:
            The third crystal may look like the second crystal in the first set of crystals. I made the guess based on the size of the crystal given.
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            n684 and n109 crystals were observed. the crystals are not equally sized and are of different colors.
        Explain:
            The guess was made after looking at the crystals reported by the second probe

        Describe:
            the crystals are not of same size and are of different colors
        Explain:
            The guess was made based on the color of the crystals from the first probe

=== Subject 16 ===
Phase 1
    Condition 1
        Describe:
            The crystals collected by the probe tended to be some shade of primary colors. Furthermore, they were of different heights. However, if you were to rearrange them, they would be able to form something that looked like the cingular bars in the advertisements on television. They would all go from smallest to tallest in pretty similar increments. the shortest of them always seemed to have the lightest shade and the shades would get darker as the length increased.
        Explain:
            Well, I tried to make sure that they were all in ascending order and that they all increased at a pretty similar increment. Furthermore, the only primary color missing was a shade of red; therefore, I tried to pick the darkest shade of red that was appeasing and reminded me of the darkest shaded crystals that the probes picked up. So, in actuality the crystals look more like shades of pink than red, but I feel thatpink is just a lighter shade of red. Consequently, I thought the colors used were appropriate.
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            They are the two most perceptible colors to the human eye. They get lighter as they increase in length. They remind me of Christmas. They increase in length in increments.
        Explain:
            Well, I wa sthinking of Christmas, and blue, purple, and white are colors that I,for some reason, have always associated with winter. So, I made the shortest crystal purple, and from there, I increased the sizes of the crystals and lightened the shade of purple into a hue of blue that eventually seem to be more white than blue. They go in ascending order in terms of length.
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            They go in a pattern of darkness as they go down in ascending order from smallest to largest. They are shades of green and purple, which are secondary colors.
        Explain:
            I used final secondary color in this crystal. I also used the same pattern I saw in the set with purple crystals. They are in ascending order from smallest to largest in terms of size.

=== Subject 22 ===
Phase 1
    Condition 1
        Describe:
            There are 6 crystals. Each of the six crystals has a unique shade and length but are of the same color. The shorter the crystal is, the lighter the shade is. The longer the crystal is, the darker the shade is. The crystals appear to have a constant size difference per jump (for example, the smallest crystal is 'x' units smaller than the 2nd smallest crystal; the largest crystal is 'x' units larger than the 2nd largest crystal) and a constant shade difference per jump as well.
        Explain:
            I took the basic principles concerning size and shade that I mentioned before about the previous two types of crystals. I then applied these principles and made six crystals. Afterwards, I chose a color not already taken by the two previous sets of crystals then applied it to this set.
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            These two sets of crystals were similar to the first three sets of crystals presented. They had the same linear-relationship characteristics as the crystals before. However, instead of getting darker as they grew longer, these crystals grew lighter. There was a problem with the method of predicting the fifth crystal because the device used to represent the fifth did not accomodate all possibilities. For example, I had a difficult time predicting the fifth crystal in the purple set because I could not create a lighter purple than the one already presented. In the red set, I could not create a crystal that was of the necessary length.
        Explain:
            I again took the principles described in the first two sets and applied it here. I made the shortest crystal the darkest and the longest crystal the lightest. I also kept the increases in length and decreases in shade constant between all the crystals. I was not presented with the problem mentioned before (where I could not create a crystal of the specific criteria with the method presented) because I was able to govern how the first and last crystals appeared.
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            These crystals appeared to hold similar properties as the previous crystals when concerned with length. However, the shades did not increase or decrease in a constant manner. They were more random.
        Explain:
            I made the crystals increase in length in an incremental fashion. However, I made the shades random even if the colors remained the same.

Phase 1
    Condition 1
        Describe:
            The crystals were sponsored by at&t and in fact, there are more bars in more places. Including outer space. They were descending in color intensity and length in all 3 collections, including the one I constructed.
        Explain:
            Based on prior observations, the longer crystals had darker shades of color. The color itself was consistent throughout the crystal, but the shade decresed with a decrease in length. Also, the other collections exhibited varying lengths and were in descending order. I chose the basic color based on what color came up first when I hit the plus sign. Had it been blue, for instance, all of my crystals would be some varying length and shade of blue.
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            The crystals were lighter in shade as the length increased.
        Explain:
            The crystals were lighter in shade as length increased. They all had the same basic color though. See previous description for choice of basic color.
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            The crystals had a damped oscillator like effect where The color alternates in intensity and decreases in length.
        Explain:
            See previous description.

Phase 1
    Condition 1
        Describe:
            the crystals of G810 and G549 had the following properties                
                                                                                      
            size : each one was slightly more or slightly less in compared to the rest
            shades: they had varying shades                                           
            color: all had the same color                                             
        Explain:
            the third crystal's color is in the middle of the the other two. 
                                                                             
            the size increases gradually so is their shades                  
                                                                             
            the color of the crystal is the same                             
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            the shorter crystals had higher shade while as the height increase the shades were less
            the color was more or less the same                                                    
        Explain:
            the color is more or less the same. the 2 crystals color moved from left to the right so the third crystal was chosen as this color
                                                                                                                                               
            as the size increases the shades decreased                                                                                         
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            in this case the shade is kept constant . the colour varied.       
                                                                               
            the colour scale moved to left as the size of the crystal increased
        Explain:
            the shade was kept a constant.                                     
                                                                               
            As the crystal size increases the colour was moved towards the left

Phase 1
    Condition 1
        Describe:
            The crystals collected by the probe have decreasing length and they all share the same color but in different gradient of shades.
        Explain:
            First I picked the color blue because every planet has a different color (ex. red and green).  Then I arranged the crystals in decreasing length order approximately one arrow longer than the other.  Finally I adjusted the shades of the smaller crystals to match the other two groups (lighter shade for shorter ones).
    Condition 2
        Describe:
            The crystals collected all have different sizes but the same color.  If you sort them in decreasing length order, you see that the gradient of the shade increases.
        Explain:
            I just picked an arbitrary bright color.  Then I changed the crystals to have different lengths.  After arranging the crystals in decreasing length order, I picked the gradient in increasing order.
    Condition 3
        Describe:
            
        Explain:
